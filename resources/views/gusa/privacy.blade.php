                <i>What this privacy and cookie policy covers</i><br/><br/>
                This policy explains how the Get America Standing and all entities in the ACTIVE WORKING (AW) Group:<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        treat personal information that is collected on all AW websites, including information relating
                        to your past use of our websites and previous order details, and
                    </li>

                    <li>how we use cookies to provide services to you or to improve your use of our websites</li>
                </ul>

                Personal information is information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address,
                email address, phone number and so on, and which is not normally publicly available.<br/> <br/>

                This policy only applies to websites owned or operated by entities in AW Group. So if a link on
                this website takes you to the website of a third party you should refer to the privacy policy
                relating to that website to understand how your personal information is managed by that third
                party or how they use cookies. <br><br><br>

                <i>Information collection and use</i><br/><br/>
                Non- registered users: <br/>
                All AW websites use cookies to help our websites work well and to track information about how
                people are using them. More information on cookies and how to control the cookies we use can be

                Registered users:<br/>
                All AW websites collect personal information when you register with them. The website you sign up to will
                collect information such as your name, email address and post code. Once you register with that
                website you will not be anonymous to us when you subsequently sign in. We collect and retain
                information about your transactions with us so that we can process your transactions and deal
                with future queries. Through the use of cookies, we will receive information from your computer
                such as your IP address (the unique number that identifies your computer when you use the internet)
                and we will record this information. We will use the information that we obtain for the following
                general purposes: to fulfil your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact
                you, conduct research and monitor the performance of our websites.<br/><br/><br/>


                <hr class="light">

                <i>Information sharing and disclosure</i><br/><br/>
                AW and any entity in AW Group will never sell or share your personal information with any
                hird party except:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        to provide the products or services you've requested from our site(s) where, for

                        website's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law AW may share your information with other entities
                        owned by AW that act as fundraisers for AW, sell AW products or provide AW information subject to your communication preferences.
                    </li>

                <i>Cookies</i><br/><br/>
                We use three different types of cookies to help our websites work well. A cookie is a small
                file of letters and numbers that we may put on your computer. These cookies allow us to
                distinguish you from other users of the website and this helps us to provide you with a
                good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.<br/><br/>

                The main categories of cookies that we use are:<br/><br/>
                <div class="insidelist">

                        <li>
                            Cookies that are necessary to run the site. Our sites use some cookies which are
                            essential to keeping the site working and provide the services you need. These
                            include cookies that enable you to:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    stay logged in for an entire visit to the site, or
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    add things to a shopping basket and keep them there until you decide to check out.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>
                            Cookies which help us improve the site – analytics cookies and web beacons.<br/>
                            We use cookies to help us see how people are using our sites. These are known as 'analytics cookies',
                            'tracking cookies' or 'web beacons'. We use analytics cookies:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    to see what website content is popular and how people are using the site
                                    as they allow us to track users movement through our websites.
                                    This type of information is amalgamated so that we can build up a
                                    picture of how the site is performing.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    to make sure we offer you a consistent service. For example,
                                    if we are testing new website content or we want to run a survey,
                                    we use cookies to remember what content you have seen or if you have
                                    already been asked to join the survey.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <br/>
                            In addition, when we email you, we may place a tiny tag (also known as 'tracking pixel' or 'web beacon')
                            on the email we send out. These do not collect any personal information, but they let us know
                            how many people are opening and reading our emails so that we can choose more popular content.<br/>

                            The information we collect using analytics cookies is anonymous and does not involve collecting
                            the name or address of any user. The analytics cookies that we use only operate through our
                            websites so they and the data they collect are not shared with anyone else.
                        </li>


                        <li> Cookies which help us get value for money from advertising.<br/>
                            We occasionally use other types of cookies that can track how our advertisements perform.
                            These cookies will help us identify which advertisements resulted in a 'click through' to Get
                            America Standing
                            website or someone downloading one of our advice sheets. <br/><br/>

                            We have begun to embed our YouTube videos using the 'Privacy-enhanced' settings. This uses
                            a cookie if the video is played. More information on this setting can be found here.<br/><br/>

                            Please note that if you prevent the use of cookies using either of these systems,
                            you will no longer be included in any tracking data from those tools across all sites
                            (not just AW websites).

                    <i>What will happen if you disable some or all of the cookies that AW uses?</i><br/>
                    It would be impossible to use our online shop without cookies enabled, as the shopping
                    basket function wouldn’t work. If you would prefer not to use our website, you can order
                    goods by phone. Call:(+44) 20 8977 554 (Mon - Fri 9am - 5pm).<br/><br/><br/>

                    You can edit your AW account Information, including your address and contact details at
                    any time. You cannot directly change the name, address, contact details and other details of
                    existing orders, but can contact AW to change order details if you need to.<br/><br/><br/>

                    <i>Contact our customer care team</i><br/>
                    We may send you certain service or administrative communications relating to AW website
                    relating to your account, regardless of your opt-out preferences. If you cancel your
                    AW Account you will no longer be sent these messages.<br/>
                    If you place an order with the site, we will keep a record of your details as entered at
                    the time of the order for as long as necessary to process your order and deal with any
                    subsequent enquiries.<br/><br/><br/>

                    <i>Changes to this privacy policy</i><br/>
                    AW Group may update this policy at any time. We will notify you about significant
                    changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary
