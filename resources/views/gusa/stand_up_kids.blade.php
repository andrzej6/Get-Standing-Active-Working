        <h1>StandUpKids</h1>

        <strong>StandUpKids</strong> (<a href="http://www.standupkids.org" target="_blank">www.StandUpKids.org</a>) provides education on
        the health risks associated with sedentary lifestyles and resources on why standing desks
        create an environment where children can become healthier and more active.<br/><br/>


        The average U.S. student is sitting an average of <strong>4.5 hours/day at school</strong> and (for kids ages 8-18)
        an <strong>additional 7 plus hours/day in front of a screen</strong>, regardless of socioeconomic status.
        <strong>Combine that with time spent doing homework, sitting at the dinner table, and driving to
            and from school</strong>, and our kids are spending nearly
        <span class="gbs-expert"><strong>85% of their waking hours in sedentary positions</strong></span>.<br/><br/>



        The <strong>Get America Standing</strong> campaign is a firm supporter of another non-profit action group
        <a href="http://www.standupkids.org" target="_blank">www.StandUpKids.org</a>.
        We both believe children’s sedentary behavior is a public health ticking time bomb and we must curtail
        the sitting habit early in life by making it easier for all our kids to move more and sit less.<br/><br/>



        Sit-stand (or standing) desks offer a simple and logical way to create a movement rich environment where
        children are more engaged and perform better academically, burn more calories, eliminate or minimize
        orthopaedic problems and disease but most importantly feel happier!  Simple right? <br/><br/>


        Calling all adults – make a decisive effort to support all of our futures with <strong>Stand Up Kids</strong>
