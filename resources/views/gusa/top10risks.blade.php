        <h1>Top 10 Risks</h1>

        In recent years international research on Sedentary Behaviour (SB) has
        increased dramatically and there is growing evidence (see below) that
        a multitude of serious health risks may be connected to "prolonged" and "excessive" sitting.
        Sedentary Behaviour science is still emerging, however the evidence
        to date is compelling. A variety of studies warn that sedentary
        lifestyles are likely to be causing as many deaths as smoking.

        <br/><br/>

        Please check our complete <a href="research">research index</a>. We make reference to evidence
        listed in the <a href="pdfs/gbs/expert_statement.pdf" target="_blank">Expert Statement</a>
        <span style="color:#0066CB;">(BLUE)</span> and supplementary research studies

        Below you will find our <strong>Top 10 Risks</strong>. These risks typically grow the higher your "<strong>Sitting Calculator</strong>"
        but more significantly for those sitting above 8 - 10 hours per day.

                                    There is evidence for an association between greater sedentary behaviour and an increased
                                    risk of cardiovascular disease among adults, school-children and youth (32, 37, 38, 71, 74,
                                    and 19). Two hours per day of screen time and sitting time were linked with a 5% and 17%
                                    increased risk of cardiovascular events, respectively (72).

                                    Increases in sedentary behaviour have been associated with increases in blood pressure among
                                    children, teenagers and adults (87, 88, 74).
                                </li>

                                    Interrupting sitting time has been associated with improved vascular function in young girls
                                    and with improved endothelial function among adults (112, 113)

                                    Both light intensity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity breaks, but not standing,
                                    might reduce inflammatory responses in adults (102).

                                    Pulmonary embolism is a common cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and
                                    it is typically a consequence of a deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities.
                                    Risk factors for deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism include age,
                                    limb immobilisation, malignancy, pregnancy, surgery, and acquired or inherited
                                    thrombophilia (90).

                                <li>
                                    Physical inactivity has been associated with incident pulmonary embolism in women (90),
                                    while prolonged work- and computer-related seated immobility was associated with an
                                    increased risk of venous thromboembolism (89, 91, 92).

                                    Regarding older adults, although there might be an association between overall sitting
                                    and TV viewing and a higher risk of blood pressure, the evidence is still inconclusive (81).

                                    Sedentary behaviour has been associated with an increased risk of cancer (37), endometrial cancer (34),
                                    colon cancer (80) and breast cancer (79)

                                    Although both body-mass index (BMI) and physical activity might be attenuating the link between
                                    sedentary behaviour and some types of cancer, researchers still suggested adults (aged 50-71)
                                    who watched TV for at least 7 hours a day had a 22% increased risk of cancer mortality relative
                                    to those who watched TV less than one hour a day (40, 77).

                                    It has been suggested that an important underlying mechanism by which sitting increases
                                    cancer risk is adiposity (excess body weight) which might facilitate carcinogenesis
                                    through insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, increased level of sex hormones and
                                    altered secretion of adipokines (76).

                                    In 2015 researchers found a positive association between sitting and body
                                    composition, heart fat, liver fat, visceral fat, and waist circumference
                                    independent of physical activity (7, 69). Interruptions of sitting
                                    time with standing and stepping were associated with lower BMI scores
                                    and waist circumference (95), but the evidence remains unclear (102).

                                <li>
                                    Researchers suggested that watching TV might lead to obesity among
                                    children and teenagers. However, factors such as unhealthy eating
                                    and physical inactivity might contribute to this association (74).
                                    Among adults, there is limited evidence for a longitudinal
                                    relationship between sedentary behaviour, weight gain and obesity risk (77, 32, 78).

                                    There is currently weak evidence for an association between sitting
                                    and obesity and waist circumference among older adults (81).

                                Metabolic syndrome has been defined as central obesity (waist circumference) plus

                                triglycerides, reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and raised
                                fasting plasma glucose.

                                        Approximately 25% of European, American and Canadian adults have metabolic syndrome (73).
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        Men and women who sit more might have up to a 73%-76% increased risk of developing
                                        metabolic syndrome compared with those who sit little, regardless of activity
                                        and cardiorespiratory fitness (68). A similar association has been reported
                                        for children and youth (71, 74).

                                        Being physically active might reduce the risk (70). Among older adults (over 60 years old),
                                        each hour of TV watching has been associated with a 19% increased risk of having metabolic
                                        syndrome (81).

                                    High amounts of sitting might be associated with a higher risk of psychological distress (43).
                                    Similarly, among overweight/obese adults, decreasing sedentary time and increasing
                                    moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity were associated with a reduced

                                    Inactive mid-aged women who sat more than 7 hours a day were three times as likely to have

                                    Screen time has also been associated with a higher risk of depression when exceeding 2 hours/day and
                                    a lower risk when screen time was less than 2 hours a day among children and adolescents (115).

                                    A 31% increased risk for developing a mental disorder has been linked to adults who engage in
                                    42 hours of watching TV and/or using the computer per week when compared with
                                    those who do so for less than 10.5 hours per week (93).

                                <li>
                                    Relative to those who were sedentary (4 hours or more/day), older adults who were moderately (2–4 hours/day)
                                    and least sedentary (&lt;2 hours/day) were 38% and 43% more likely to age successfully, respectively (50).

                                    Less convincing evidence is available for the association between sedentary behaviour and anxiety.
                                    However, moderate evidence suggests a link between total sitting and a greater risk of anxiety (96)

                                    Although there seems to be a positive association between sitting and depressive symptoms
                                    in children, teenagers and adults, the evidence remains inconclusive (74, 86).

                                    The type and context of the sedentary behaviour is important, as activities such as computer use,
                                    reading, playing board games and craft activities might be associated with a reduced risk of

                                    In terms of occupational health, lower back pain is the number one cause of
                                    disability and one of the major risk factors for absenteeism (61).

                                <li>
                                    Sitting time has been positively associated with both low back pain
                                    and neck-shoulder pain intensity among blue-collar workers (101, 116).
                                    When asked to interrupt their sitting at work every 30 min during the day,
                                    overweight/obese office workers showed a 32% reduction in lower back discomfort,
                                    compared to seated work (13).

                                    However, there is currently insufficient evidence for a link between occupational
                                    and screen-based sitting and musculoskeletal pain, independently of other factors,
                                    among both children and adults (61, 74).

                                    Older adults watching TV at least 6 hours a day might have poorer

                                    Weight bearing activities such as standing, walking and running stimulate
                                    hip and lower body bones to grow thicker denser and stronger. Scientists
                                    partly attribute the recent surge in cases of osteoporosis to lack of activity.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Osteoporosis is particularly important in the context of an ageing population.
                                    Prolonged sitting might be a risk factor for bone health in women, even in
                                    those who are physically active. How sedentary time is accumulated might also
                                    be important: the longer (rather than the more frequent) the sitting bouts,
                                    the higher their deleterious effects on bone mineral density (BMD) (51).

                                <li>
                                    Some specific sedentary activities (screen-based) are negatively associated
                                    with bone health in youth. This relationship between screen-based time and
                                    bone health is independent of the total amount of physical activity,
                                    but not independent of the frequency of muscle strengthening and
                                    vigorous activities. Frequent, short bouts of such activities
                                    (muscle strengthening and vigorous activity) interspaced with periods
                                    of sedentary behaviours appear to be beneficial (118).

                                    The risk of all-cause mortality might be lowest in standing/walking occupations, especially among women (106).

                                    Increasing standing time among Australians aged 45 and above seemed
                                    to lower the risk of all-cause mortality (110, 111).
