        <h1 class="activeworking">US Health and Safety Regulations</h1>



        The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) is the official government agency responsible
        for the workplace and enforcing United States Department of Labor legislation.
        <br/><br/>


        Under the OSH Act 1970, employers are responsible for providing a safe and healthful workplace.
        <strong>Get America Standing </strong>is encouraged that the OSHA guidelines relating to the office environment
        have been recently updated to include “standing” at a computer workstation, but we would like them to go further.
        <br/><br/><br/>




        OSHA guidance on <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/positions.html" target="_blank" class="link-line">
            Good Working Positions</a> whilst basic includes the following:
        <br/><br/>


        <div class="gbs-innovate link-line">
            <ul>
                <li>Standing</li>
                <li>Upright sitting</li>
                <li>Declined Sitting</li>
                <li>Reclined Sitting</li>

            </ul>


            <i>"Regardless of how good your working posture is, working in the same posture or sitting still for
                prolonged periods is not healthy".</i>

            <br/><br/>
            You should change your working position frequently throughout
            the day in the following ways:<br/><br/>
            <ol>
                <li>Make small adjustments to your chair or backrest.</li>
                <li>Stretch your fingers, hands, arms, and torso.</li>
                <li>Stand up and walk around for a few minutes periodically.</li>
            </ol>


            OSHA guidance on <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/components_desk.html" target="_blank">Desks</a>
            now states that "desks should be able to accommodate a variety of working postures".
