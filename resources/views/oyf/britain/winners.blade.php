        “Before <strong>On Your Feet</strong> (OYF) day, the majority of our staff, other than our winner Tom, spent the
        day working away at their desks. However, Tom’s always had a very “stand-up” approach to the working day.
        Tom feels more energetic and confident when he stands up on the phone, but stretching the phone
        and bending down to reach the computer started to become a bit of a pain for him.<br/><br/>

        The sales and marketing team really enjoyed OYF as it was a chance to get moving ready for the weekend ahead,
        Tom actually ripped his work trousers while testing out some of his moves (luckily you can’t see that
        in the video!). It took us a few attempts and lots of laughs to record our Boomerang video for the OYF
        competition but it was all worth it when we found out we’d won.<br/><br/>

        Since winning best male, Tom’s been the envy of the office with his new Yo-Yo Desk MINI®
        and he loves the fact he can stand up all day with his brand-new desk.”

    <div style="font-style: italic">
        The Purple Sprout office has always been a particularly active one as the team are all
        interested in health and wellbeing, particularly researching new recipes and fitness regimes
        – a few members of the team regularly exercise at local gyms and partake in fitness boot camps
        (especially as we head into summer!)<br/><br/>

        During OYF Day 2017, we started the day by doing funny dances filmed using the Instagram
        filter, Boomerang, for our social media pages (the video of Tracey Thake, Purple
        Sprout Director, was the video that won us the competition!). As the weather was so
        nice that day, two members of the team also went for a walk around a nearby housing
        estate during their lunch hour to stretch their legs.<br/><br/>

        The Yo-Yo Desk MINI® is a fantastic addition to our office and is used daily by Tracey.
        She at least tries to stand up for the first few hours of the day – motivation wasn’t
        needed when we googled how many calories she could burn by standing at her desk!
