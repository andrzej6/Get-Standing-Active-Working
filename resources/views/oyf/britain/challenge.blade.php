    <h1 class="oyf-newpink">The Challenge</h1>

    On 29th April, Get Britain Standing in association with Active Working are asking the nation to unite
    against prolonged office sitting by taking on the challenge to get on their feet. <br/><br/>

    We want workplaces and individuals across Britain to sit less and move more during their working day.

    <div class="oyf-newblue fbigger fbold">"Get up offa that thing" - ideas to get you moving</div><br/>



    <ul class="oyf-ultabbed">
        <li>Run a lunchtime fitness workshop for the office.</li>
        <li>An alert will sound at random times and everyone must stand up when it does. A fine for those caught napping.</li>
        <li>Take regular breaks from your computer, stand up, stretch and walk around the office. Ignore the bemused looks. </li>
        <li>Make phone calls standing up.</li>
        <li>Use the stairs.</li>
        <li>Have standing or walking meetings.</li>
        <li>Have one less chair than people at meetings.</li>
        <li>Get everyone to move around with each new agenda item.</li>
        <li>Ban internal emails. Everyone must walk to colleagues to discuss work. Be prepared that some people may have aged -
            depending on how long youâ€™ve left it.</li>
        <li>Organise a lunchtime walk. Walk to work, or get off a few stops earlier and walk the rest of the way.</li>


    </ul>

    <br/>
    If you have any questions please email: <span id="email_hidden"><b>@</b></span>.

    <br/><br/>
    Donâ€™t forget to inform your co-workers, other company colleagues and
    external business contacts that you are taking part.
