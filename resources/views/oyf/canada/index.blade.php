    The On Your Feet Canada” Challenge dares you to take James Brown at his word and convert 'sitting time'
    to 'standing time'. Follow some simple changes - it’s easier than you think: <br/><br/>

    <ul>
        <li>Stand during phone calls</li>
        <li>Stand and take a break from your computer every 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Use the stairs rather than the elevator</li>
        <li>Have standing or walking meetings</li>
        <li>Eat your lunch away from your desk</li>
        <li>Walk to your colleague's desk instead of phoning or emailing them</li>
        <li>Stand at the back of the room during presentations</li>
    </ul>
