    <br/><br/><br/>



    <div class="oyf-newblue fbigger fbold">"Get up offa that thing"</div><br/>
    The <strong>On Your Feet</strong> challenge dares you to take James Brown at his word and convert 'sitting time' to
    'standing time'.  Follow some simple changes - itâ€™s easier than you think:
    <br/><br/>

    <ul>
        <li>Stand during phone calls</li>
        <li>Stand and take a break from your computer every 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Use the stairs</li>
        <li>Have standing or walking meetings</li>
        <li>Eat your lunch away from your desk</li>
        <li>Walk to your colleague's desk instead of phoning or emailing them</li>
        <li>Stand at the back of the room during presentations</li>
    </ul>

    So <strong>Friday 28th April 2017</strong> is your chance to get the ball rolling and encourage your employees to
    take a stand. Team up with colleagues and see how much "sitting time" you can reduce on the day.
