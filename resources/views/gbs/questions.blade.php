                            We recommend that you try to stand <i>50 percent of your working day</i>
                            If that is too much we would suggest a very <i>minimum of 2 hours</i> but you
                            can mix it up in spurts as little as 10 – 15 minutes.

                            We recommend that you avoid standing more than 6 hours whilst at work or
                            70% of your working day. To avoid getting tired you should mix it up,
                            and move around as much as you can to encourage blood flow. Work for
                            one or two hours at a time, take breaks, walk off and mix it up every day.

                    Q.3  Don’t you get tired standing too much?
                    <span class="ico"></span>

                            People who have not used a Sit-Stand desk before often
                            wonder how someone can stand at a desk for eight hours a
                            day to do work. Don’t you get tired?<br/><br/>

                            Try to structure your day and avoid spending more than
                            two hours in a row at your desk to avoiding tiring your out.<br/><br/>

                            Obviously you can push yourself to go beyond two hours,
                            but the diminishing returns really start to kick in after that.
                            You quickly fatigue or drop in output quality or lose focus.
