                             moving around and looking at different things. Your eyes are
                             not built to stare at objects, like a monitor, close up for
                             long periods of time. They like to look at things in the
                             distance and change focus from near to far and back again.
                             This is exercise for the eye muscle, which like all muscles,
                             is designed to be dynamic, to change, and not locked into
                             one setting for long durations."<br/><br/>

                             Tip! – If you are a high intensity computer user and you want
                             to look after your eyes, go outside and stare at the mountains,
                             or buildings, or whatever is off in the distance for 15
                             minutes every two hours – preferably every hour.
                             This could save your eyesight long term.
