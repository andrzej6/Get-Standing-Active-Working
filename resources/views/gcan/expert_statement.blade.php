        <h1>Expert Statement on the Sedentary Office</h1>




        <div class="expert-content">

            An expert statement was launched at the <a href="http://activeworking.com/summit/2015/" target="_top">Active Working Summit 2015</a> by <strong>Public Health England</strong> with <strong>Active
                Working C.I.C.</strong>  to provide guidance for employers and staff working in an office environment.

            <br/><br/>

            The statement, developed by a panel of leading British and International researchers on sedentary
            behaviour provides recommendations to combat the potential ills of long bouts of sitting.

            <br/><br/>
            Ahead of the <strong>full release</strong> of the statement, five core recommendations have been provided as an initial
            guide for employers, ergonomists, office furniture and equipment suppliers and occupational health promoters.

            <br/><br/>
            <ol>
                <li>Progression should be made towards at least two hours of standing per day and light activity, eventually progressing to a total accumulation of four hours per day.</li>
                <li>You should try and break prolonged periods of sitting by standing at regular intervals. Sit to stand work stations are highly recommended.</li>
                <li>Prolonged periods of static standing should also be avoided.</li>
                <li>When first trialling standing office workers may feel some fatigue that will require some time to adapt to. These sensations should be able to be relieved by changing your posture or taking a quick walk.</li>
                <li>Companies should promote workers to think about how much time they spend sitting outside of work too.</li>

            </ol>
