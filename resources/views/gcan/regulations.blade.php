        <h1 class="activeworking">Canadian Health and Safety Regulations</h1>

        <div class="">


            The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (COHS) is the official government
            agency responsible for the workplace. Federal regulations were last updated in 2007
            with Part XIX of the COHS call on employers to incorporate ergonomic-related hazards
            responsible for the development of MSDs into their legally mandated workplace Hazard
            Prevention Program.

            Typically the act of sitting is rarely viewed as a health and safety concern. When it is
            considered the link is limited to Musculoskeletal Disorders (or MSDs) meaning injuries
            and disorders that affect the human body's movement or musculoskeletal system
            (i.e. muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, discs, blood vessels).
            <br/><br/>

            Among provincial jurisdictions British Columbia has the most comprehensive ergonomic
            regulations. It requires employers to consult joint health and safety committee members
            and affected workers in identifying, assessing and controlling the risks associated with
            the development of musculoskeletal injuries.
            <br/><br/>

            The province of Ontario recommends that computer users take a 5-minute break every hour.
            This is a requirement for organizations governed by the Regulation for Health Care
            and Residential Facilities, and considered a best practice in other organizations.

                Get Canada Standing believes both federal and provincial guidelines relating
                to prolonged and excessive sitting (in the office environment) be significantly
                updated and go considerably further.

                or sitting still for prolonged periods is not healthy".
